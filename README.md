# datasci_9_data_prep-


I started working on this Nov.21 in Google Shell, but the next morning I kept getting this message. I waited two hours and still was left on the loading screen with no change.

12:10pm - It has started working again, which I am very thankful for this Thanksgiving. 


## 1. Dataset Selection:
   
The dataset I have chosen is Cancer Rates in Lake County, Illinois. 

The second dataset I have chosen is Birth Statistics in Lake County, Illinois. 


## 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation Plan:

Brief Description of Cancer Rates- Lake County, Illinois
This dataset is looking at Rates of cancer present in Lake County, Illinois. Information included are FID, ZIP, Lunc_bronc, Breast_can, Urinary_sy, Prostate_C, and All_cancer. There is also shape area and shape length. All Cancer columns listed are at a rate per 100,000.

The ZIP is the zip codes present in Lake County, the Colorectal Cancer shows cancer in colon and intestines. Breast cancer signigfies breast cancer present in tissue. Lung_broc represents lung cancer present. Prostate_C represents prostate cancer. 

This dataset also has 27 rows and 10 columns.


Brief Description of  Birth Statistics- Lake County, Illinois

This dataset looks at birth rates in Lake County, Illinois.
The columns include LBW which is low birth rate and if a baby is less than 2500 grams that indicates a LBW. This is represented as a percentage. Next there is preterm. This looks at the percent of births that happened before they reached 37 weeks pregnancy. Next is Teen Birth. This looks at the rate of women who gave birth at the ages of 15,16,17,18 and 19. Next is birth rate. This again looks at the rate of people who give birth. Specifically, per every 1,000 women. And the last columns is 1st trimester of Care. This looks at the percent of women who got medical care and support within the first 13 weeks of their pregnancy. 




The intended machine learning task for each dataset (classification or regression).

The steps needed to clean and transform the data. Consider aspects like missing values, outliers, encoding categorical variables, standardizing or normalizing, etc.

Identify the independent (predictors) and dependent (target) variables in each dataset.
