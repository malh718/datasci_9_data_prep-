# datasci_9_data_prep-


I started working on this Nov.21 in Google Shell, but the next morning I kept getting this message. I waited two hours and still was left on the loading screen with no change.

12:10pm - It has started working again, which I am very thankful for this Thanksgiving. 


## 1. Dataset Selection:
   
The dataset I have chosen is Cancer Rates in Lake County, Illinois. 

The second dataset I have chosen is Birth Statistics in Lake County, Illinois. 


## 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation Plan:

Document your plan for data cleaning and transformation in a markdown file. Include the following:
A brief description of each dataset.
The intended machine learning task for each dataset (classification or regression).
The steps needed to clean and transform the data. Consider aspects like missing values, outliers, encoding categorical variables, standardizing or normalizing, etc.
Identify the independent (predictors) and dependent (target) variables in each dataset.
